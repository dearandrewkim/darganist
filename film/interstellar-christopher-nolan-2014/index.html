          <p>Darganist is where you go when you're looking for something something new and want a humans help to find it. We write about the things that move us, frustrate us, and, not infrequently, cause us to be incapacitated by overwhelming joy.</p>
          <p>We won't write half-heartedly about things that don't matter. We won't tell you what you already know. We won't agree with prevailing opinion because it's easy and safe to do so.</p>
          <p>We'll simply direct your attention to something we've listened to, read or watched, and ask the crucial question: on a scale of one to nuclear holocaust, how likely is this to improve your day?</p>

            <p>[INITIAL RESPONSE]</p>
            
            <p>The science-fiction film Interstellar - which isn’t to be confused with the lesbian porn film Into Stella - is, to put it as delicately as possible, a colossal goddamn travesty. It’s not that Christopher Nolan has too few ideas, it’s that he has too many – and they’re all crammed into a film that ends up sounding far too much like a new age sales pitch (because love is a gravity-modulating function of the space-time continuum, amirite?).</p>
            
            <p>[A SYNOPSIS]</p>
            
            <p>Surprise! The earth is going to shit. Every day, the good men and women of small town America are assailed by crop-destroying dust storms. Why? Could it be god’s way of punishing us for glazed-donut bagels and reality TV? I don’t know! We’re never told what (presumably hilarious) series of error leads the near-downfall of our species, which means that we can’t avoid it. So thanks for nothing, Christopher Nolan, you overpaid Judas.</p>
            
            <p>What matters is that the distressing state of Earth gives Matthew McConaughy a reason to stop being a farmer (which involves staring at your crops while drinking Bud Light) and transform, over the course of twenty-four miraculous hours, into an astronaut (which involves staring at Anne Hathaway while drinking Bud Light).</p>
            
            <p>[THE CAMERA]</p>
            
            <p>It’s hard to fault Christopher Nolan’s technical mastery of the space voyage genre. He’s no Kubrick, to be sure, but his shots are inventive, the camera roaming back and forth to show us both the claustrophobic details of life on a ship and the immensity of the space which surrounds it. There’s a brilliant moment when we hear a thunderstorm played over a slow shot of Saturn’s rings. Is that what future travellers into deep space will yearn for? The simple sound of rain? Maybe. Or maybe they’ll just yearn for the days when Christopher Nolan made good movies.
            Â¯_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯</p>
            
            <p>[THE MISSION]</p>
            
            <p>The crew’s mission, we’re to understand, is straightforward:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Recipe for Christopher Nolan Space Film –
                <ol>
                  <li>Leave space on a ship flown by somebody who is hired by NASA without knowing that a circle in three dimensions become a sphere. Seriously.</li>
                  <li>Discover that NASA is also hiring people with more emotional baggage than Hamlet.</li>
                  <li>Learn that amongst these people is Anne Hathaway. Not a character being played by Anne Hathaway. Just Anne Hathaway.</li>
                  <li>Go through a wormhole.</li>
                  <li>Experience some nausea and realise that this has nothing to do with entering the fifth dimension and everything to do with Michael Caine’s dialogue. .</li>
                  <li>Find a suitable planet to call home.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I’ll stop there because any further details will deprive you of the hope that this film isn’t completely fucking predictable.</p>
            
            <p>[BUT IS IT SUCH A BAD FILM, JAYMES? WHAT CAN WE LOOK FORWARD TO?]</p>
            
            <p>Okay, okay. If you pawn your grandfather’s Rolex to buy a movie ticket, you will at least get to enjoy the following:</p>
            
            <p>1) A robot that has been designed to look like a giant Kit-Kat.</p>
            
            <p>2) Three jokes. Only three. All are told by the robot.</p>
            
            <p>3) Matt Damon turning up to what he seems to think is another Bourne film. It’s not, Matt. GET OFF THE SET.</p>
            
            <p>4) Finishing the film and being awarded an honorary PhD in Quantum Mechanics.</p>
            
            <p>5) There never being a sequel.</p>
            
            <p>[FINAL VERDICT]</p>
            
            <p>At the end of the day, I’d still recommend that you see Interstellar. It’s beautiful to look at and Nolan still deserves credit for his visual explanations of some very difficult concepts (such as ‘tesseracts’). Having said that, it seems to be a basic principle of relativity (which features heavily in the film) that time passes more slowly while you’re watching it. So if you care about character development, emotional complexity, script development, and believable acting – well, believe it or not, you’d be better off watching Into Stella instead.</p>
            
            <h2 id="andrew">Andrew</h2>
            
            <p>Personally, one of the pleasures of watching a space film is having theÂ accreditation to judge itsÂ scientific plausibility, thanks to the one unit of physics which I have studied during my first year of the engineering degree. With my superior knowledge in quantum mechanics, I can tell you that there were two things which are impossible in real life, theoretically incorrect and just annoying.</p>
            
            <p>(SPOILER ALERT) The Main characterÂ is immortal</p>
            
            <p>I hate movies where the main character manages to survive all worst possible situations imaginable – like, I don’t know, getting sucked into a neutron star. I’m not ignoring the possibility of the existence of wormholes, hyperspace, space travel, what not. But, I’m pretty sure that a person can’t just casually goÂ travelingÂ into a black hole, do their thing (transcend time and space), pop out of the black hole andÂ surviveÂ without exploding or being shred to pieces. I mean, if not eating, sleeping or shitting for 24 Earth years wasn’t difficult enough to handle, am I right?</p>
            
            <p>The Robot
            Oh man, I fucking hated the robot. First of all, the robot was basically five massive metal jenga blocks screwed together in the middle. The directors have successfully designed the heaviest, largest and the most inefficient robot for future space-travel. Technology has advanced so far that trends make a loop – the robot is powered by what is presumably Window DOS.Â The robot has a screen as its face which has no function but to display some random lines of computer codesÂ to try to convince the audience that it is a robot, not a piece of shit.Â I read on Wikipedia that the producers have tried to avoid designing anthropomorphic features in the robot- but this seems so far from the truth. In the future, it seems like robots will be designed so closely to human to a point that it will understand sarcasm, crack spontaneous jokes with a perfect slightly auto-tuned American male accent, and jiggle when excited.</p>
            
            <p>Otherwise, absolutely incredible graphics.</p>
            
            <p>Watch Interstellar if you have lots of time to kill, are interested in using love to transcend the dimensions ofÂ space, time and gravity, and don’t find Anne Hathaway annoying.</p>
