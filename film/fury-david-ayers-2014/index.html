          <p>Darganist is where you go when you're looking for something something new and want a humans help to find it. We write about the things that move us, frustrate us, and, not infrequently, cause us to be incapacitated by overwhelming joy.</p>
          <p>We won't write half-heartedly about things that don't matter. We won't tell you what you already know. We won't agree with prevailing opinion because it's easy and safe to do so.</p>
          <p>We'll simply direct your attention to something we've listened to, read or watched, and ask the crucial question: on a scale of one to nuclear holocaust, how likely is this to improve your day?</p>

            <p>Take it from me -  the worst kind of date movie is one in which German soldiers ignite, sizzle and die at random intervals. At least, it should be – if your companion enjoys watching this happen, you might want to give him or her the slip.
            Fury is a traumatizing film. It documents, unflinchingly, the enormous creativity that warring people bring to bear on the important task of killing each other. It’s also a testament to the joy that such killing can bring.</p>
            
            <p>We view this grisly spectacle through the eyes of Private Norman Ellison, a clerical worker who, for reasons unknown, is assigned to a Sherman tank commanded by Brad Pitt pretending to be a Sergeant. I think his name is Don Collier. In fact, it is. I just googled the names because they’re seldom used and, when they are, come out in an exasperating drawl that makes ninety per cent of the film’s dialogue completely incomprehensible.
            Half an hour into Fury, we already know what type of story we’re about to be told. This is a classic e pluribus unum (‘from many come one’) tale of a small surviving force (i.e. the Sherman tank) taking on a much larger foe (i.e. the German army). Think ‘St George and the Dragon’ or the valiant last stand  of the 300 Spartans at Thermopylae.</p>
            
            <p>This predictable narrative would have disappointed me – and even seemed a little trite – if it weren’t for the unusual subtlety with which Fury unfolds. After all, the film doesn’t rely entirely on exposed viscera to achieve its sickening realism. Collier, for example, is no unscathed war hero – away from his men, he crouches beside the tank, vomits, takes deep breaths. “Best job in the world,” he and his men repeat after every almost-got-killed-and-survived-through-dumb-luck encounter. It becomes a little less convincing each time.</p>
            
            <p>There’s a scene that shows Team Fury rolling through a picturesque Bavarian town and violently protesting its views on urban planning. Five minutes into this positively joyous sequence, a fire alarm went off in my cinema and we were evacuated by a despondent team of ushers who, for the most part, seemed like they too had just laid waste to half of Germany. Waiting on George Street, I wondered: is it worth going back in? I asked my date. “It’s fine either way,” he said. “I know how World War II ends.”
            In the end, we did return, and I’m glad for it. For though Fury is far from a perfect film, its grim cavalcade of carnage is relieved, every so often, by a welcome example of human compassion. Truth? I will never, ever watch it again. Second truth? I would still encourage you to see it once. Probably alone.</p>
