          <p>Darganist is where you go when you're looking for something something new and want a humans help to find it. We write about the things that move us, frustrate us, and, not infrequently, cause us to be incapacitated by overwhelming joy.</p>
          <p>We won't write half-heartedly about things that don't matter. We won't tell you what you already know. We won't agree with prevailing opinion because it's easy and safe to do so.</p>
          <p>We'll simply direct your attention to something we've listened to, read or watched, and ask the crucial question: on a scale of one to nuclear holocaust, how likely is this to improve your day?</p>

              <p>artist: Talking Heads</p>

            <p>Favourite ice cream flavor? Hokey pokey. Favourite Harry Potter book? Prisoner of Azkaban. Favourite twentieth century musical Jewish homosexual? Leonard Bernstein*. Ask me what my favourite of anything is and Iâ€™ll tell you. Unless you ask about music Â – because try as I might, I just can’t select one musical artist to rank above all others. Instead, I keep shuffling names on a shortlist that has forever – and will forever – include Talking Heads.</p>
            
            <p>Thereâ€™s a strong case to be made that, of all the Talking Heads albums, at least four are good enough to be recorded on a golden disc and sent towards someÂ distant star as an example of humanity’s cultural achievements. Still, if I had to pick just one, I would – after bitterly cursing the house and family of my interrogator – go with the 1980 albumÂ Remain in Light for the following reasons:</p>
            
            <p>It has twelve tracks and the first six are glorious. Which isn’t to say that the last six aren’t also fantastic – they are. ButÂ the first six should come with a Surgeon-General’s warning because, I kid you not,Â Â I would fuckingÂ snort thatÂ music if I could.
            The album was produced by Brian Eno, who, it turns out, is the same genius that wrote the soundtrack to my childhood.
            The album was directly inspired by chief songwriter David Byrne’s obsession with African music and the experience of his colleagues in a Haitian voodoo cult.
            It will make you dance. And lord help you if it doesn’t.
            Let’s be clear about one thing – David Byrne is an alchemist whose talents make those of Midas seems positively pitiful. With Remain in Light,Â he blends funk, electro-pop, synth-music, African drumming, rock and god knows how many other musical styles. I’m always impressed by the visual nature of ‘Born Under Punches’. It’s spacious, carefully contoured, easy to inhabit. I can’t listen to it without imagining some sort of pastel fireworks display. The rest of the songs are equally accommodating – focus on the bass line in ‘Houses in Motion’ instead of the percussion and you’ll completely rediscover the song.</p>
            
            <p>‘Remain in Light’ ultimately transcends theÂ sum of its variegated parts toÂ become, if not sublime, then so tantalisingly close that you’ll listen to it forever, hoping to hear some overlooked detail. It’s complex, Â colourful, and catchy enough to wake a nun up from a coma.Â In fact, my only regret when I take it toÂ a desert island will beÂ for all theÂ other great Talking Heads songs that Iâ€™ll have to leave behind*.</p>
            
            <p>Listen to Remain In Light becauseÂ your house-mates are outÂ and you feel like dancing in the living room.</p>
            
            <p>*This is my favourite TH songÂ and it’s on a different album.</p>
