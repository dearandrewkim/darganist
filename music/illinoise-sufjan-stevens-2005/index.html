          <p>Darganist is where you go when you're looking for something something new and want a humans help to find it. We write about the things that move us, frustrate us, and, not infrequently, cause us to be incapacitated by overwhelming joy.</p>
          <p>We won't write half-heartedly about things that don't matter. We won't tell you what you already know. We won't agree with prevailing opinion because it's easy and safe to do so.</p>
          <p>We'll simply direct your attention to something we've listened to, read or watched, and ask the crucial question: on a scale of one to nuclear holocaust, how likely is this to improve your day?</p>

            <h2 id="andrew">Andrew</h2>
            
            <p>Who am I? I am the cutest, shyest, and most musically talented indie-folk boy who is 39 years young. I have recorded many albums in different genres such as electronica and lo-fi folk. I may have written slightly too many Christmas albums (10 albums in total).</p>
            
            <p>I am Sufjan Stevens.</p>
            
            <p>I love all his album, but my favourite one has to be Illinois the most well known album of his. What’s it about? You’ve guessed it, it’s about Illinois, one of the states in America. And Sufjan has really done his homework searching through criminal, literary and historical documents (wikipedia). What resulted is a highly acclaimedÂ twenty two track album exploring the history, culture, art, and geography of Illinois. This ranges from UFO Sightings, to the state’s holiday “Casimir Pulaski Day”, to a story about a famous serial killer John Wayne Gacy (also known as Killer clown) who raped and murdered at least 33 boys and young men.</p>
            
            <p>Illinoise is a fantastic album to listen to from start to finish. The mini orchestra in this album consists of brass, strings, piano and a chorus of hipsters which gives the album an element of grandiosity. Thanks to Sufjan’s innocent baby voice and the simplicity of the songs, this album remains humanistic and playful instead of patriotic or propagandist. The album is also quite musically sophisticated exploring different genres, textures and musical techniques such as unconventional time signatures (5/4 in Come on Feel the Illinoise!). I would say that this album is very creative.</p>
            
            <p>The titles of the tracks are also creative. Maybe slightly too creative. For example the second track’s title is called “The Black Hawk War, or, How to Demolish an Entire Civilization and Still Feel Good About Yourself in the Morning, or, We Apologize for the Inconvenience but You’re Going to Have to Leave Now, or, ‘I Have Fought the Big Knives and Will Continue to Fight Them Until They Are Off Our Lands!'”. It’s slightly long but that’s okay. It’s unique I guess.</p>
            
            <p>My favourite song from this album is “They Are Night Zombies!! They Are Neighbors!! They Have Come Back from the Dead!! Ahhhh!”. I love the dramatic unison of strings in the background layered over the monotonous syllabic chant of hipsters. It’s incredibly addictive. Please mind the video compilation of entire zombie movies known to mankind.</p>
            
            <p>Listen to Illinoise if you want to be taken on an exciting musical adventure to Chicago with Sufjan as your cute and adorable tour guide.</p>
