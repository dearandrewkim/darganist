          <p>Darganist is where you go when you're looking for something something new and want a humans help to find it. We write about the things that move us, frustrate us, and, not infrequently, cause us to be incapacitated by overwhelming joy.</p>
          <p>We won't write half-heartedly about things that don't matter. We won't tell you what you already know. We won't agree with prevailing opinion because it's easy and safe to do so.</p>
          <p>We'll simply direct your attention to something we've listened to, read or watched, and ask the crucial question: on a scale of one to nuclear holocaust, how likely is this to improve your day?</p>

            <h2 id="jaymes">Jaymes</h2>
            
            <p>Thereâ€™s a lot to be said for listening to music on vinyl. You get that exciting campfire crackle before the needle catches on the recordâ€™s outermost ring. You get the satisfaction of a large album cover thatâ€™s physically pleasing (and sometimes surprisingly thoughtful – Stevie Wonderâ€™s Talking Book has braille on it; the Rolling Stoneâ€™s Their Satanic Majesties Request, a hologram designed to transfix hallucinating acid-trippers). Most importantly, you get a sense of commitment – thereâ€™s no shuffle button you can press, no easy way to skip a track you dislike. The album is to be enjoyed as a whole, instead of cherry-picked for whatever songs are worth saving in your iTunes library.</p>
            
            <p>Kate Bushâ€™s fifth album Hounds of Love is a perfect example of this. Released in 1985, on vinyl, cassette, and CD, it demands your attention for a full forty-eight minutes – WITHOUT RELIEF.</p>
            
            <p>Thereâ€™s no obvious thematic consistency (as with a more political album like Marvin Gayeâ€™s Whatâ€™s Going On). There is, however, a sustained attempt to create a sound that is, at times, almost mystical. For all that Hounds of Love is a pop album – and some of its songs, like Big Sky, are insanely catchy – itâ€™s also a very weird piece of work.</p>
            
            <p>The album begins with its three most accessible songs. Running Up That Hill, The Big Sky, and Hounds of Love are incredible fun. The beat is fast, the melodies playful, and the lyrics all too relatable: â€œI never know whatâ€™s good for me.â€ There are the first suggestions, however, of a motif that recurs more explicitly later in the album. â€œItâ€™s in the trees, itâ€™s coming!â€ yells a voice at the beginning of Hounds of Love. Whatâ€™s coming? Throughout the album, the answer will change as different voices interrupt a narrative that is, for the most part, represented by Kate Bush (the protagonist, as it were, of the album). In Under Ice, itâ€™s a mysterious figure trapped beneath the surface of a frozen lake; in Waking the Witch, itâ€™s a guttural, demonic voice that puts Bush on trial (â€œConfess to me girl!â€). And in Watching You Withou Me (one of my favourite tracks off Hounds of Love), itâ€™s Kate Bush, standing quietly beyond what can be perceived by person sheâ€™s observing:</p>
            
            <p>You can’t hear me.</p>
            
            <p>You can’t hear what I’m saying.</p>
            
            <p>You can’t hear what I’m saying to you.</p>
            
            <p>The idea that we are never alone, but accompanied always, and often unknowingly, by the people and things that exist behind a thin veil of ignorance provides Hounds of Love with both its mystery and its appeal. But thereâ€™s so much more than that. Thereâ€™s Kateâ€™s Bush voice, rich and flexible; Jig of Life with its quasi-liturgical spoken monologue (â€œwe are if the going water and the goneâ€); the music videos which are, like any that feature Kate Bush, fucking amazing.</p>
            
            <p>Listen to Hounds of Love because you believe, deep inside, that it’s still the early eighties and we should all still be wearing shoulder-pads.</p>
