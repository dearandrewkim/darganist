          <p>Darganist is where you go when you're looking for something something new and want a humans help to find it. We write about the things that move us, frustrate us, and, not infrequently, cause us to be incapacitated by overwhelming joy.</p>
          <p>We won't write half-heartedly about things that don't matter. We won't tell you what you already know. We won't agree with prevailing opinion because it's easy and safe to do so.</p>
          <p>We'll simply direct your attention to something we've listened to, read or watched, and ask the crucial question: on a scale of one to nuclear holocaust, how likely is this to improve your day?</p>

            <p>“The book would not meet me half way, nothing in it made the least attempt to be agreeable, and that always gives the reader an irritating sense of inferiority.” - Jung on Ulysses, 1932</p>
            
            <p>Much of modern art is aloof, which, depending on how you define it, isn’t a particularly modern claim (see above). I’d wager that most gallery visitors and music enthusiasts are familiar with the experience of being confronted with something beautiful (or not) and wondering what on earth it means.</p>
            
            <p>Liz Harris, the musician and artist behind Grouper, seems very much aware that her style of music might alienate some listeners. Disengaged, the first track on her 2007 album Dragging a Dead Deer Up a Hill, suggests, with its very title, an artist who isn’t particularly determined to communicate an explicit message. Indeed, the lyrics of Grouper’s songs vanish behind guitar chords, sounding, for the most part, like conversations in a distant room. Therein lies the album’s unique charm. The melodies on Dragging a Dead Deer Up a Hill are fragmented but beautiful, indistinct but strangely haunting. It’s a textural experience, a dark arabesque.Â It’s what the night sky would look like if viewed through a thin piece of gauze.</p>
            
            <p>My favourite track is titled Stuck:

            <p>I have died of boredom listening to this album so please drag my dead body up a hill.</p>
