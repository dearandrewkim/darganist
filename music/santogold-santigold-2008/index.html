          <p>Darganist is where you go when you're looking for something something new and want a humans help to find it. We write about the things that move us, frustrate us, and, not infrequently, cause us to be incapacitated by overwhelming joy.</p>
          <p>We won't write half-heartedly about things that don't matter. We won't tell you what you already know. We won't agree with prevailing opinion because it's easy and safe to do so.</p>
          <p>We'll simply direct your attention to something we've listened to, read or watched, and ask the crucial question: on a scale of one to nuclear holocaust, how likely is this to improve your day?</p>

            <h2 id="andrew">Andrew</h2>
            
            <p>A couple of years ago, wearing my earphones, I rocked up to one of my boring engineering lectures and sat next to a friend. He took one of the earphones out of my ear and listened for a moment. The, surprised, he commented, “I didn’t know you were a fan of hip hop!”.</p>
            
            <p>But my friend, I thought, this no ordinary hip hop we’re talking about – itâ€™s Santigold.</p>
            
            <p>Santigold is an American rapper, singer, and producer. She blends electronica, alternative hip-hop and synthpop to create catchy and unique music. Unlike Nicki Minaj, who begs the audience to notice the size of her ass, Santigold, like Janelle Monae, is a talented black women with a whole lot of class.</p>
            
            <p>She doesnâ€™t sing about sex. Nor does she characterise herself as a survivor of unrequited love (which appears to be the case in 99% of songs these days). In fact, Santigold doesn’t sing about love at all. She’s got bigger and more interesting things to talk about. Or, you know, other statements and commands to make. She’s either telling you what’s going to happen or what you should think and do. She’s the boss.</p>
            
            <p>“We think you’re a joke
            Shove your hope where it don’t shine”</p>
            
            <p>NB: (I should print this quote and stick it up in my room)</p>
            
            <p>I present to you, Santigoldâ€™s music video of â€œL.E.S Artistâ€. It is surprisingly emotionally liberating.</p>
            
            <p>When I listened to her music, I assumed she was a crazy bad-ass alpha female. But if you watch her interviews, she’s a very articulate and educated woman who clearly has a creative vision that she wishes to accomplish.</p>
            
            <p>Look out for the two girls who dance alongside Santigold. They wear sunglasses, don’t smile, and do a fun, crazy dance in perfect synchrony. They also have their own facebook page.</p>
            
            <p>I would like to finish off with another of Santigold’s hypnotic and addictive music videos. This one is for a song called “Big Mouth”.</p>
            
            <p>Listen to Santigold when you want to experience art in the form of catchy synthpop while watching strangely addictive videos.</p>
