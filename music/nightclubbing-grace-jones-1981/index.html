          <p>Darganist is where you go when you're looking for something something new and want a humans help to find it. We write about the things that move us, frustrate us, and, not infrequently, cause us to be incapacitated by overwhelming joy.</p>
          <p>We won't write half-heartedly about things that don't matter. We won't tell you what you already know. We won't agree with prevailing opinion because it's easy and safe to do so.</p>
          <p>We'll simply direct your attention to something we've listened to, read or watched, and ask the crucial question: on a scale of one to nuclear holocaust, how likely is this to improve your day?</p>

              <h1>Nightclubbing</h1>
              <p>artist: Grace Jones</p>
              <p>year: 1981</p>
              <p>rating: 4</p>
            </div>
            <h2 id="jaymes">Jaymes</h2>
            
            <p>Grace Jones is a strong black woman who donâ€™t need no man. Which is weird, because her best-known single is called: â€˜I Need A Manâ€™.</p>
            
            <p>That song appeared on her 1977 debut album Portfolio and introduced a singer who, after working as a model in New York and Paris, had signed with Island Records, a label born, like her, in tropicalÂ Jamaica. Portfolio was followed by Fame, Muse, Warm Leatherette, and, four years later, Nightclubbing -Â a cover album that has been described as having “something for everyone: reggae, electronics, disco, blues â€“ even a snatch of salsa funk. ”</p>
            
            <p>My mother introduced me to Nightclubbing (the album, not the activity) when I was thirteen years old. I listened to ‘Walking In the Rain’Â hundreds of times, until I developed the useless but – or so I told myself – impressive ability to lip-synch the whole thing. And I’m sure it was only some scandalized guardian angel that made me stop there. For the next track -‘Pull Up to the Bumper’ – contains lyrics like this:</p>
            
            <p>My lines are short, Iâ€™ll fix you up</p>
            
            <p>So won’t you please come on</p>
            
            <p>Shiny sleek machine, you wheeled</p>
            
            <p>I’ve got to blow your horn</p>
            
            <p>Pull up to my bumper, baby</p>
            
            <p>In your long black limousine</p>
            
            <p>Just pull up to my bumper, baby</p>
            
            <p>And drive it in between</p>
            
            <p>Pull up to it and don’t drive through it</p>
            
            <p>Back it up twice, now that fits nice</p>
            
            <p>Race it, straighten it, let me lubricate it</p>
            
            <p>And that is… um. Well. As any high school English student will tell you with pride, that isÂ a series of euphemisms.</p>
            
            <p>One of the things I love most about Grace Jones is her voice. It’s a deep, flexible and muscular instrumentÂ that coils up tightly for restrainedÂ verses, with Jones barely singing at all, andÂ then strikes with untamed relish. ‘Walking in the Rain’ is a perfect example of this. OrÂ listen to the way she kills the chorus of ‘Libertango’ – in French, no less! She is – and I know I repeat myself – from some other, better place.Â Â</p>
            
            <p>In researching for this review, I came across a piece written byÂ Adrian Thrills for NME. He writes: “I spent an otherwise-miserable weekend afternoon with the sound of Grace swirling around my little earphones, grooving on songs effortlessly sung but put together with a jeweller’s eye for detail”. Musical kinship, I thought – I’ve done the exact same thing. And perhaps this will surprise you. After all,Â NightclubbingÂ doesn’t soundÂ likeÂ consolation music. But, if it’s true what they say, then what misery seeks is company – and Grace Jones is so completely present in, and melded with, herÂ performances, that to listen to them closely is to be in the best company of all.</p>
            
            <p>Listen to her music on a quiet Sunday and I promise that she’ll have you dancing like you’ve just been cured by a faith healer. Pull up to that goddamn bumper.</p>
            
            <p>P.S. This is Grace Jones at 64 years old. She’sÂ found the philosopher’s stone or something, I swear to god.</p>
