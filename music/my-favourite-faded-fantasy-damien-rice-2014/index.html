          <p>Darganist is where you go when you're looking for something something new and want a humans help to find it. We write about the things that move us, frustrate us, and, not infrequently, cause us to be incapacitated by overwhelming joy.</p>
          <p>We won't write half-heartedly about things that don't matter. We won't tell you what you already know. We won't agree with prevailing opinion because it's easy and safe to do so.</p>
          <p>We'll simply direct your attention to something we've listened to, read or watched, and ask the crucial question: on a scale of one to nuclear holocaust, how likely is this to improve your day?</p>

              <h1>My Favourite Faded Fantasy</h1>
              <p>artist: Damien Rice</p>
              <p>year: 2014</p>
              <p>rating: 3.75</p>

            <p>Finally. After 8 years of waiting since his last album came out, Damien Rice has produced yet another wonderfully depressing album.</p>
            
            <p>For those of you who aren’t familiar with Damien Rice, he’s both a talented singer-songwriter and a hopeless romantic who understands all of your heartbreaks. His songs are dramatic, lyrical and incredibly (yet wonderfully) depressing. I promise that you’ll be wanting to cry whilst you listen to his achingly defeated voice sing over his guitar asÂ the violins and cellos weep through their harmonies and vibratos. And after you finished listening, you’ll realise that love is powerful yet cruel, but perhaps it’s precisely these emotions which defines us as humans.</p>
            
            <p>“You could be my poison, my cross,
            My razor blade
            I could love you more than life
            If I wasnâ€™t so afraid”</p>
            
            <p>His newest album “My Favourite Faded Fantasy” is just as great as his previous albums “O” and “9”. I would say that his newest album is more organised and “done up”, but he definitely hasn’tÂ lost his style.</p>
            
            <p>If I wereÂ ever in aÂ situation where I couldÂ chooseÂ someÂ background music while I’m breaking up with someone, I don’t think I could select a more appropriate song than Damien Rice’s I don’t want to change you.</p>
            
            <p>Listen to My Favourite Faded Fantasy when you become a victim of love and feel like a lost little soul. CrawlÂ underneath your bedsheets and play his wonderful music over and over again until you feel better.</p>
