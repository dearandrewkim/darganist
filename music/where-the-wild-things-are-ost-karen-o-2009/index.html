          <p>We'll simply direct your attention to something we've listened to, read or watched, and ask the crucial question: on a scale of one to nuclear holocaust, how likely is this to improve your day?</p>

            <p>Note: The Keyword for this review is “magical”.</p>
            
            <p>Where the Wild Things AreÂ was my favourite book from childhood… not. I’d be lying if I claimed that I grew up reading this book or that I had everÂ read it.</p>
            
            <p>Anyway, a couple of years ago, I saw the film adaptation of this book directed by Spike Jonze. It is truly magical. Although the plot is supposedly from a children’s book, a significant portion of the film is completely terrifying. Told through Max (the little boy) and seven freaky-looking gigantic creatures, the film explores unhappiness, loneliness, broken dreams, personality clashes, uncontrollable anger and various other depressingÂ ideas.</p>
            
            <p>The original soundtrack by Karen O which accompanies the film isÂ just as amazing. I never really listen to OSTs because they’re usually lame. This one is different – it is a fantastic album which you must listen to even if you haven’t seen the film. Karen O and her supporting children’s choir really take you to a land of fairytales. One of the main songs from the albumÂ All is LoveÂ was nominated for “Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media” in 2010.</p>
            
            <p>Pitchfork rated this album 6.8. They also rated her latest album “Crush Songs” 5.8. I tried to read their review to understand why they rated it so low. But the way Pitchfork write their reviews is so complicated and full of shit that I have no fucking clue what the fuck they’re on about. So don’t listen to them. Listen to me, Andrew Kim from Darganist- IT IS MAGICAL. If you needÂ to experience magic first hand,Â see the video below. Prepare to cry.</p>
            
            <p>Listen to Where The Wild Things Are OST when you need Karen O and her crew of kids to take you to a place where everything is going to be okay.</p>
