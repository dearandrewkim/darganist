          <p>Darganist is where you go when you're looking for something something new and want a humans help to find it. We write about the things that move us, frustrate us, and, not infrequently, cause us to be incapacitated by overwhelming joy.</p>
          <p>We won't write half-heartedly about things that don't matter. We won't tell you what you already know. We won't agree with prevailing opinion because it's easy and safe to do so.</p>
          <p>We'll simply direct your attention to something we've listened to, read or watched, and ask the crucial question: on a scale of one to nuclear holocaust, how likely is this to improve your day?</p>

            <h2 id="andrew">Andrew</h2>
            
            <p>I’ve always been a Coldplay fan. That is, until they recorded Viva La Vida in 2008. (Seriously? Live your life asÂ its album nameÂ should explain it).</p>
            
            <p>When it comes to Coldplay, I am definitely one of those people who say, “their old stuff used to be so much better”. I’m sorry, but their music style completely changed with Viva La Vida. I definitely support bands experimenting with their musical style and instruments. That’s all good, until they startÂ writing songs that sound cheesy and you hear their music in nightclubs.</p>
            
            <p>Ghost Stories is no different from Coldplay’s recent albums – Viva La Vida, Mylo Xyloto… they all sound pretty crap. What happened to that intimate, simple style of music that stuck in your head and gaveÂ you warm fuzzy feelings? Like all those songs from A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002)Â and Parachute (2000)…</p>
            
            <p>Since it may seem like IÂ amÂ one of those people who complains all the time, I’ll write down the things that I don’t like about this album in dot-point form:</p>
            
            <p>*MIDI-sounding drum beats in the background
            *Too much swelling up and down ie. too much emphasis on climax – typical of the music you would hear in parties to get everyone in the mood.
            *Synthesizer in the background to create that “ambient” sound
            *Too much orchestral instruments which makes it lose its clarity.</p>
            
            <p>Listen to this album if you are a teenager and want to have some cheesy poppy party music playing in the background at your 15th birthday party.</p>
            
            <h2 id="jaymes">Jaymes</h2>
            
            <p>I’m totally with Andrew on this one. ‘Coldplay’ is only interesting when it refers to an obscure sexual fetish.</p>
