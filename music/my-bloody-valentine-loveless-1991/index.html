          <p>Darganist is where you go when you're looking for something something new and want a humans help to find it. We write about the things that move us, frustrate us, and, not infrequently, cause us to be incapacitated by overwhelming joy.</p>
          <p>We won't write half-heartedly about things that don't matter. We won't tell you what you already know. We won't agree with prevailing opinion because it's easy and safe to do so.</p>
          <p>We'll simply direct your attention to something we've listened to, read or watched, and ask the crucial question: on a scale of one to nuclear holocaust, how likely is this to improve your day?</p>

            <p>I remember how I first discovered My Bloody Valentine’s 1991 shoe-gaze classic Loveless. I was reading Pitchfork reviews (a late-adolescent pastime) when I saw that the magazine had listed Loveless as the best album of the 1990s. A bold claim, I thought, and, curious but unconvinced, obtained a copy posthaste.</p>
            
            <p>Track one is titled ‘Only Shallow’ and this was my reaction upon hearing it for the first time:</p>
            
            <p><img alt="alt text" title="Logo Title Text 1" src="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png" /></p>
            
            <p>To be fair, the genre known as ‘shoegazing’, with its distorted tsunamis of sound, can be overwhelming to the uninitiated and, frankly, pretty goddamn unpleasant. The key – though it sounds banal – is patience. Loveless is a vast sonic landscape. Its thickly layered melodies soften harsh guitar chords and occasionally wash lyrics out entirely. In fact, it’s one of the few CDs I know of whose music is perfectly represented by its album cover – blurry but bright, with almost indiscernible details:</p>
            
            <p>Philip Glass once said in an interview that ‘music is a place’. This is particularly true of Loveless – it’s not music you listen to so much as inhabit. Kevin Shields, the album’s guitarist, producer and chief songwriter, has achieved a sort of musical impressionism: the closer you look, the better you can appreciate all the delicate details from which Loveless emerges.</p>
            
            <p>Anyhow, it didn’t take me very long to warm to it. These days, my reaction when I play any track off Loveless is more like this:</p>

            <p>This is a perfect music to listen to when you’re getting stoned. Not particularly a fan, but I appreciate this abstract soundscape.</p>
            
            <p>Note: I have not heard of this album before Jaymes’ review but two of my friends love this album.</p>
