          <p>Darganist is where you go when you're looking for something something new and want a humans help to find it. We write about the things that move us, frustrate us, and, not infrequently, cause us to be incapacitated by overwhelming joy.</p>
          <p>We won't write half-heartedly about things that don't matter. We won't tell you what you already know. We won't agree with prevailing opinion because it's easy and safe to do so.</p>
          <p>We'll simply direct your attention to something we've listened to, read or watched, and ask the crucial question: on a scale of one to nuclear holocaust, how likely is this to improve your day?</p>

            <p>Who am I? Well, I would like to say that Im a non-judgmental, friendly, and pretty okay-looking Asian dude. But is that who I really am?</p>
            
            <p>Dataclysm by Christian Rudder doesn’t use surveys to explore who we are. Surveys tend to be skewed because people complete them as the person they think they are. For example, people will generally put that they have no racial preference for dating. Christian Rudder, the author of this book, is a Harvard mathematics graduate and one of the founders of OK Cupid. He explores who we are using OK Cupids metadata for analyses which draw upon not only the user’s bio (sexual preferences, age, race, location), but also the people he or she has rated and messaged, as well as the words in their self-description.</p>
            
            <p>The aggregate data reveals patterns that individual users mightn’t comfortably admit to. OK Cupid is all about ego – but metadata is all about id. It shows us who we are when we think nobody’s looking. The result? Humans are fucking terrible and Rudder has the evidence to prove it. For example, male users of all included races (asian, black, latino, and white) are least likely to express a preference for black women. Black, latina, and white female users don’t like asian men (but asian women do!). Pro tip: if you can plan your next life, and want to be super popular within the online dating scene, I recommend being born as a white man.</p>
            
            <p>Apart from his OKcupid metadata, Rudder uses data from Facebook, google search, twitter, and reddit to tell incredible stories which could only exist in our technological age. These ranges from a joke on “twitter” that, within 24 hours, had spawned millions of retweets and death threats by a twitter mob, to the ability of metadata to predict epidemic outbreaks (see Google Flu Trends, http://www.google.org/flutrends/)</p>
            
            <p>This book is highly relevant to anyone who uses the internet – so I guess thats everyone. It’s also extremely well written (the author is witty and hilarious at times). One thing that I really love about the book is its minimalist and beautiful graphs. Mmmm… so pleasing to my designer eyes (I would totally hang the ˜attractiveness percentile vs message/week area graph on my wall).</p>
            
            <p>So, whats the deal with metadata? 1984-style dystopia? Or accurate social mirror that will help us make more informed decisions about ourselves? You decide.</p>
            
            <p>Read this book if you use the internet.</p>
