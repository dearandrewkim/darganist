          <p>Darganist is where you go when you're looking for something something new and want a humans help to find it. We write about the things that move us, frustrate us, and, not infrequently, cause us to be incapacitated by overwhelming joy.</p>
          <p>We won't write half-heartedly about things that don't matter. We won't tell you what you already know. We won't agree with prevailing opinion because it's easy and safe to do so.</p>
          <p>We'll simply direct your attention to something we've listened to, read or watched, and ask the crucial question: on a scale of one to nuclear holocaust, how likely is this to improve your day?</p>

            <p>Last Sunday was City of Sydneyâ€™s First Annual Zine Fair and Jaymes and I had a table selling Urban Pancakes. Unfortunately, the day coincided with a face-melting heatwave and rail trackwork. Despite the poor attendance at the zine fair, we met an awesome and friendly girl called Zoe. And she became even cooler when she bought our zines. So naturally (as people do in this era) we became friends on Facebook later that day, thereby declaring our friend status to the public.</p>
            
            <p>We asked Zoe if she could write a review for Darganist and within a couple of hours – BAM! – it was ready to be published on Darganist. So, here it is â€“ Zoeâ€™s review of Valley of the Dolls.</p>
            
            <h2 id="zoe">Zoe</h2>
            
            <p>I studied girlâ€™s made-up faces during high school, more than I studied anything else. Their lack of subtlety in application usually betrayed desperate futures and relationships with boys named Tony or Darren. Seeing the same girls now, their habits are the same, just tireder, and their bone structures have sunken into (almost) middle age. My point is that no one â€˜made itâ€™ out of this lower-middle class hole.</p>
            
            <p>Stacy* tried to make it in showbiz. In later years, I saw her in Kings X and she was wearing some maxi dress that I wanted to see a dog shit on. In writing this review of Valley of the Dolls, Iâ€™m thinking about what it was like for her to dance and sing under those hot studio lights, caked on make-up leaking, producers staring at her crotch, and last nightâ€™s coke from Jason still at the back of her nasal passage…</p>
            
            <p>Depending on how you want to interpret it, VotD could be a manual for how to keep a man on your terms via incidental riches and pretty features, or how to trick girls into making you money if theyâ€™re already hot and/or talented.</p>
            
            <p>In other words, I really liked it. This was an easy read. Then again, I probably wouldnâ€™t find it hard to eat a bbq meatlovers with extra cheese. On a serious note, the cruelty of women towards each other commands a timeless voyeurism. The short glimpse into the mind of an addict deserves further exploration and reminded me of Plathâ€™s Bell Jar. Valley of the Dolls reads like digestible fiction but it gave me much to think about in terms of gender, sex and fame.
            Read â€˜Valley of the Dollsâ€™ after a few shitty online dates, but only if they went badly.</p>
